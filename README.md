# ArcGis-projects
Welcome to my ArcGIS Projects repository! Here, you will find various geospatial analysis projects I have created using ArcGIS. This repository serves as a showcase of my GIS skills and my ability to work with different tools and datasets to produce maps and analyses. I used SQL to query, filter, and manipulate large datasets efficiently.

## Projects Included

1. Population Density of the European Union

This map visualizes the population density across EU member states. It provides a overview of densely populated areas.

2. Protected Areas in Slovenia

This map highlights Slovenia's protected areas, showcasing the distribution of national parks, nature reserves, and other conservation zones.

3. Earthquake High-Risk Areas in Slovenia

This map identifies regions in Slovenia that are at a high risk of earthquakes. It is based on geological and historical seismic activity data of ground acceleration information.
